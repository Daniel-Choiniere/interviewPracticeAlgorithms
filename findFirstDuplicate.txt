Time Left Over: -5min (Took 20 min)

Retrospective:
Got the brute force almost working, but realized that I would not be able to pass all test cases. 
Went back to the drawing board and decided to sort the array first before checking for matches so 
that I dont have to loop through the entire array each time.
After sorting the array I can just go throuh and check each position against the next position in the array, 
if they are identical then we know that the array contains a duplicate.
